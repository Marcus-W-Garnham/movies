Movie Analysis

Group members:
Marcus Garnham, Henrique Treve, Ruchi Sharma, Kouame Kouassi, Shola 

Outline:
We will be analysing what makes films successful in the New Millennium Era/Period of films. Which are films produced in after the 1990â€™s. We will be analysing what makes films successful either ratings wise or profitability wise. This will make the data very useful for those just starting or want to be apart of the movie industry or even those who are in the movie industry. We will specifically be looking at USA movies.

Questions:
(1) Do movies become profitable the longer the runtime is?
(2) Are different genres more profitable than other genres?
(3) Does the runtime of the movie affect the public rating it gets?
(4) Does the genre of a movie determine or affects its public rating?
(5)Do the fan reviews per genre in the entire time period affect the worldwide gross incomes? 
(6)are there movie directors that are more favoured, how good are the movies they have directed so far and their career overall?
(7) Does the time of year the movie gets released affect the profitability the movie?
